# Changelog
All notable user-visible changes to **marco-core** are documented here.

This project follows **Semantic Versioning** and uses the **Keep a Changelog** format.

Version scheme note: `marco-core` and `marco-shared` follow independent semver from the application binaries (marco/polo). The library tracks API stability for crates.io consumers; breaking API changes increment the major version.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- CommonMark spec conformance test (`tests/commonmark_spec_conformance.rs`)
  loading the official 652 examples (and a small set of Marco extras) from
  `tests/spec/*.json`, with a regression-guard baseline. Set
  `MARCO_SPEC_STRICT=1` to require 100% conformance,
  `MARCO_SPEC_VERBOSE=1` to print failing examples.
- `documentation` key and explicit `include` list in `Cargo.toml`. The
  published `.crate` tarball now ships `src/`, `README.md`, `LICENSE`,
  `Cargo.toml`/`Cargo.lock`, and the spec fixtures
  (`tests/spec/*.json` + `tests/spec/README.md`) for downstream
  conformance verification; everything else (`.github/`, integration
  test sources, `target*/`, `CHANGELOG.md`) stays out.
- `tests/spec/README.md` documenting the upstream source and
  CC-BY-SA 4.0 attribution for `commonmark.json`.
- `.gitignore` for the standalone-crate layout (covers `target/`,
  `target-*/`, coverage artifacts, common editor/OS files).

### Changed
- CI workflows reshaped for the standalone library: `ci-linux.yml` now
  installs only `pkg-config` + `libfontconfig-dev`, runs
  `cargo fmt`/`clippy -D warnings`/`test`/doc-tests; `ci-windows.yml`
  switched to native MSVC (no MSYS2/GTK setup); `publish-crate.yml`
  triggers on `v*` tags, runs `cargo publish --dry-run` before publishing.
- `devskim.yml` ignore globs trimmed to the paths that actually exist in
  this repository.
- `README.md` rewritten with a top-down pipeline ASCII diagram, a complete
  module/file map, supported-Markdown matrix, and runnable usage snippets.
- `.github/instructions/rust.instructions.md` retargeted at the
  pure-Rust library context (removed GTK/GUI guidance).

### Removed
- Stale `target-linux/` build artifact directory left over from the former
  workspace layout.
- `marco-rust` chat mode (belonged to the consuming editor, not this crate).

## [1.0.2] - 2026-04-28

### Added
- New CI workflow for publishing `marco-core` to crates.io.

### Changed
- Debian package runtime dependency compatibility was broadened for newer Ubuntu-family distributions by allowing `libxml2-16` as an alternative to `libxml2`.
- Workspace refactor renamed the legacy `core` crate to `marco-core` and moved app-oriented shared logic/assets into `marco-shared`, clarifying the reusable library boundary.

### Fixed
- Linux package build script path handling was hardened to correctly locate built binaries when Cargo target output is configured outside the default `target/` directory.

### Removed
- Removed the legacy `core` crate path/name from the workspace in favor of `marco-core`.

### Security
- Verified mitigation status for GHSA-82j2-j2ch-gfr8: dependency graph resolves to patched `rustls-webpki` 0.103.13.
- Updated transitive `rand` to 0.8.6 across the workspace lockfile to keep the dependency graph current with upstream advisories.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-04-15

### Added
- First stable release published to crates.io as `marco-core`.
- Public API: `parse`, `Document`, `Node`, `NodeKind`, `render`, `RenderOptions`, `MarkdownIntelligenceProvider`, `ParserCache`, `parse_to_html`, `parse_to_html_cached`, `sanitize_input`, `sanitize_input_with_stats`.
- `mermaid-rs-renderer` dependency switched from git source to crates.io (`0.2.1`).

### Changed
- Library and shared crates (`marco-core`, `marco-shared`) now version independently from the application binaries (`marco`, `polo`).
- Removed `global_parser_cache`, `shutdown_global_parser_cache`, and `safe_preview` from the crate-root public API — these remain accessible at `marco_core::logic::cache` / `marco_core::logic::logger` for internal use.

### Security
- Nothing yet.

## [0.23.1] - 2026-04-14

### Changed
- Rust toolchain updated to 1.94.1 (MSRV bumped from 1.93.0).
- GTK ecosystem upgraded to gtk4 0.11.2 / glib 0.22.5 / cairo-rs 0.22.0 / gdk-pixbuf 0.22.0 / gio 0.22.5 series.
- `reqwest` updated to 0.13 and `toml` updated to 1.x.

### Security
- Updated `rand` dependency to address unsound behavior (GHSA-cq8v-f236-94qc).

## [0.23.0] - 2026-04-12

### Added
- Paged preview document API for CSS Paged Media workflows: `wrap_preview_html_document_paged` with `PageViewOptions` (paper size, orientation, margins, page numbers, columns per row, export mode, and standalone-export mode).
- Base preview stylesheet module (`render::base_css`) and compositing pipeline that layers structural base CSS first, then theme tokens.
- New layout settings fields for page-view and zoom state persistence: page-view enabled flag, paper, orientation, margin, page-number toggle, update delay, columns-per-row, and preview zoom.

### Changed
- Preview theming model was refactored from monolithic per-theme stylesheets to base structural CSS plus theme-token overrides, reducing duplication and aligning rendering across themes.
- Heading anchors now wrap the full heading text, making the heading itself the clickable permalink target.

### Fixed
- Hard line break parsing now correctly accepts two **or more** trailing spaces before newline (CommonMark behavior), and consumes all trailing spaces to avoid stray-space artifacts before `<br />`.
- Paragraph blank-line detection now follows CommonMark blank-line rules (ASCII space/tab only), so non-breaking-space spacer paragraphs are preserved.
- Inline link parsing now handles nested bracket content correctly (for example image-in-link syntax like `[![alt](img)](url)`).

### Removed
- Removed decorative anchor/link icon adorners from generated preview heading/link markup.

## [0.22.0] - 2026-04-08

### Added
- `intelligence::toc` module — extracts a table of contents from a parsed document (`extract_toc`), generates URL-safe heading slugs, produces Markdown TOC output (`generate_toc_markdown`), and replaces or inserts TOC marker blocks in source text (`replace_toc_in_text`).
- `table_auto_align` field added to `EditorSettings` and `toc_depth` field added to `LayoutSettings` in the settings schema.

### Changed
- HTML renderer now generates an `id` attribute and a hover-anchor link for every heading, including headings without an explicit `{#id}` marker; duplicate slugs receive a `-1`, `-2`, … suffix to guarantee uniqueness.

## [0.21.0] - 2026-03-13

### Added
- In-process intelligence engine (`core/src/intelligence/`) — replaces the previous `lsp/` module; provides syntax highlighting, hover information, Markdown completions, and diagnostic analysis behind a clean public API boundary.
- Two diagnostics catalogs in RON format (`diagnostics_catalog_marco.ron`, `diagnostics_catalog_markdownlint.ron`) — map diagnostic codes to human-readable titles, descriptions, severity, and fix suggestions.
- `get_position_span` — returns the tightest AST node span enclosing a cursor position; supports hover suppression logic in the editor.
- `intelligence/markdown/` boundary module — structured reinterpretation of the AST for intelligence consumers (blocks and inlines classification).
- LSP protocol adapter stub (`intelligence/lsp_protocol.rs`) for future language server integration.
- `DiagnosticsFilterSettings` struct in `EditorSettings` — per-severity toggles (errors, warnings, hints, infos) for the diagnostics display; replaces the previous `linting` boolean.
- `diagnostics_underlines_enabled`, `diagnostics_hover_enabled`, and `markdown_hover_enabled` fields in `EditorSettings` for fine-grained intelligence feature control.
- `SettingsManager::reload_settings` is now `pub` to allow external callers to trigger a settings reload.

### Changed
- Replaced `core/src/lsp/` module with `core/src/intelligence/` — Markdown intelligence capabilities (highlights, diagnostics, completions, hover) are now organized under feature-area sub-modules (`editor/`, `markdown/`, `analysis/`, `catalog/`).
- `EditorSettings`: removed `auto_pairing` and `linting` fields; added `diagnostics_underlines_enabled`, `diagnostics_hover_enabled`, `markdown_hover_enabled`, and `diagnostics_filter`.

### Fixed
- Image nodes now carry the span of the full `![alt](url)` syntax rather than just the alt-text fragment; this prevents zero-length spans when alt text is empty.
- Footnote definition nodes had their span end set to end-of-document due to use of the inclusive span range helper; corrected to use the exclusive variant so subsequent content is not erroneously enclosed within a footnote definition span.

### Removed
- Old `core/src/lsp/` module (completion, diagnostics, highlights, hover) superseded by `core/src/intelligence/`.

## [0.20.0] - 2026-03-04

### Added
- Centralized settings manager (`SettingsManager` / `Settings` in `logic/swanson.rs`) — thread-safe RON-based settings with typed sub-structs for editor, appearance, layout, language, telemetry, window, file, and polo configuration; supports change listeners, file I/O, validation, and auto-repair on load.
- Bookmark and emoji history persistence in `Settings`: `get_bookmarks`, `set_bookmarks`, `record_emoji_usage`, `get_top_emoji_usage`, and `clean_recent_files`.
- `PoloSettings` and `PoloWindowSettings` structs for Polo-specific persistent configuration.
- Emoji shortcode completion API (`logic/text_completion.rs`) — OnceLock-cached static list of `EmojiCompletionItem` values with `normalize_completion_query` and `emoji_shortcode_matches_query` prefix-match helpers.
- Pure-Rust Mermaid diagram rendering (`render/diagram.rs`) — native diagram rendering via `mermaid_rs_renderer` with a `MERMAID_MAX_CHARS` safety limit; full GitHub-style dark and light themes via `create_mermaid_theme`.
- KaTeX math rendering (`render/math.rs`) — `render_inline_math` and `render_display_math` with MathML output and a global `OnceLock<KatexContext>` for performance.
- Unified HTML preview document builder (`render/preview_document.rs`) — `wrap_preview_html_document()` shared by Marco and Polo; embeds interactive table-resize CSS and JS, heading anchor link CSS and SVG, background-flash prevention, and the `window.MarcoPreview` JS API.
- Layout state enum (`logic/layoutstate.rs`) — `LayoutState { DualView, EditorOnly, ViewOnly, EditorAndViewSeparate }` with a `layout_state_label` string helper.
- Cross-platform detection helpers (`logic/crossplatforms.rs`) — `Platform { Linux, Windows, Unknown }` enum, `detect_platform()`, and `is_dark_mode_supported()`.

### Changed
- Settings system expanded from minimal telemetry and window structs (0.18.0) to a full application settings hub with typed per-component structs, audit-logged file I/O, and per-component typed change listeners.

## [0.18.0] - 2026-02-09

### Added
- System locale detection helper (`detect_system_locale_iso639_1`) with ISO 639-1 normalization.
- Telemetry settings support (persisted settings fields for enabling telemetry + tracking whether the first-run dialog has been shown).
- Inline SVG icons for About dialog link buttons (GitHub, Link, Bug, Help).

### Changed
- Portable mode detection on Linux and Windows now prefers a writable `config/` directory next to the executable (more reliable portable installs).
- Asset root validation now requires `language/` alongside `icons/` and `themes/`.
- Settings change listeners are now stored as `Arc` and notified outside the listener lock (reduces lock contention and avoids re-entrancy hazards).

### Fixed
- Reduced false-positive portable-mode detection in development environments by tightening Linux portable heuristics.

## [0.17.1] - 2026-02-04

### Changed
- Improved cross-platform compilation with refined conditional compilation attributes for Linux and Windows builds.
- Enhanced platform-specific code organization using explicit `cfg(target_os)` gates.

### Fixed
- Resolved Linux build compilation error in font loader module (missing `HashMap` import under platform-specific code path).

## [0.17.0] - 2026-02-03

### Added
- **Platform abstraction module** (`core::paths::platform`) for OS-specific path implementations.
- **Windows portable mode detection** - automatically uses local config/data when exe directory is writable.
- **Linux platform paths** - XDG-compliant user directories (`~/.local/share/marco`, `~/.config/marco`).
- **Windows platform paths** - Standard Windows locations (`%LOCALAPPDATA%\Marco`) with portable fallback.
- **Asset root validation** - verifies asset bundles contain required directories before accepting paths.

### Changed
- **Refactored path system** to use platform-specific modules with explicit `cfg` attributes.
- **Install location detection** now properly distinguishes between system/user/portable installs.

## [0.16.0] - 2026-02-02

### Added
- **Full cross-platform support** for Windows and Linux.
- Platform-agnostic core library works identically on both platforms.

### Changed
- Migrated logger from `static mut` to `OnceLock<T>` for Rust 2024 compatibility.
- Removed all unsafe blocks for logger access in favor of safe initialization pattern.

### Fixed

## [0.15.2] - 2026-01-30

### Added
- Added `DualView` layout **inline SVG** to the Core icon loader.
- Icon loader documentation updated to describe inline SVG usage and HiDPI rasterization expectations.

### Changed
- Icon loader and related docs updated to formally deprecate icon-font usage across the workspace and to prefer inline SVG assets.

### Fixed
- N/A

### Removed

  - Asset root discovery now supports Windows paths (`%LOCALAPPDATA%`, `%PROGRAMFILES%`, `%PROGRAMDATA%`)
  - Install location detection works for both Linux (`/usr/share`, `~/.local/share`) and Windows (Program Files, AppData)
  - Platform-appropriate log directories (Linux: `~/.cache/marco/logs`, Windows: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Marco\logs`)
  - Config and data directories use platform-specific locations via `dirs` crate

### Changed
- Logger now uses platform-appropriate cache directory instead of hardcoded `cwd/log`
- Path detection uses conditional compilation for Linux and Windows specific logic

### Fixed
- Removed `anyhow` dependency, replaced with standard `Result<T, Box<dyn std::error::Error>>`
- Fixed all Result type annotations throughout parser and logic modules
- Fixed thread safety issues for error types used with GTK's `gio::spawn_blocking`

### Removed
- `anyhow` dependency removed from core library

## [0.14.0] - 2026-01-18

### Added
- Extended GitHub-style admonitions with custom headers, e.g. `> [:joy: Happy Header]` (quote-styled, with optional emoji/icon + custom title).
- Marco_Extended tab blocks (`:::tab` + `@tab ...` + closing `:::`), parsed into `TabGroup`/`TabItem` and rendered as a no-JS tab UI in HTML preview.
- Marco_sliders slideshow decks (`@slidestart[:tN]` … `@slideend` with `---` / `--` separators), parsed into a dedicated AST and rendered as an interactive slideshow in the preview.
- Source-aware LSP highlighting helper (`compute_highlights_with_source`) to color structural marker lines like tab block markers.

## [0.13.3] - 2026-01-17

### Added
- Per-application icon/logo helpers in `SharedPaths` (Marco vs Polo), with backwards-compatible fallbacks for older shared icon filenames.
- New Marco and Polo logo/icon assets are now supported by the shared asset resolution layer.

### Changed

## [0.13.2] - 2026-01-15

### Added
- Extended definition lists (Markdown Guide / Markdown Extra-style).
- Headerless pipe tables (delimiter-first, no header row).
- Inline footnotes (`^[...]`) (inline definitions collected into the document footnotes section).
- Platform mentions (`@username[platform]` with optional display name) rendered as profile links for known platforms.
- Inline task checkbox markers (`[ ]` / `[x]` / `[X]`) inside paragraphs (including mid-paragraph markers and after hard line breaks).

### Changed
- Emoji shortcode handling now uses a full shortcode dataset for broader support.
- LSP highlight output is now sorted and de-duplicated for deterministic application.
