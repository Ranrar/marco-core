//! `marco-core` is a pure-Rust Markdown engine with editor intelligence.
//!
//! Typical flow:
//! 1. Parse input text into an AST with [`parse`].
//! 2. Render the AST to HTML with [`render()`].
//! 3. Optionally run editor analysis via [`MarkdownIntelligenceProvider`].
//!
//! # Example
//! ```rust
//! let doc = marco_core::parse("# Hello")?;
//! let html = marco_core::render(&doc, &marco_core::RenderOptions::default())?;
//! assert!(html.contains("<h1"));
//! assert!(html.contains("Hello"));
//! # Ok::<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>>(())
//! ```
